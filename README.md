This is our final oop project which we will be building using raylib or sfml library.
The project will cover most of oop concepts like abstraction polymorphism encapsulation etc.
We have tried our best to inculcate everything we have learnt throughout the semester
The Code Base initially comprises of unfinished codes but we will soon compile code into different header files once we complete all the functions pertaining to each class as well as game logic.
The Game Logic Comprise of Randomly generated Blocks of size 4 which we will be falling down and will fit into it.
The Line would be cleared when all the elements in a row are filled for which a line clearing function will be called.
We would use a multitude of colours for blocks whose colours and their properties are stored in color.cpp and color.h.
We have a Position Class which would identify the position of blocks.
The Grid of the game is a 20 by 10 array which would be an int array.If a Block is present the array block is set to 1 otherwise it is set to 0.
